This tab compares sentences in a user input article to fact checked claims made in the PUBHEALTH fact-check dataset. Sentences in the article with a high similarity to claims made in the fact-checked datasets are returned for the user to see and compare. The aim of this analysis is to alert the user to possible claims in the data which can be verified with previous data. Currently, the Bert Similarity model is the only model option that can be used to evaluate the similarity of sentences to fact checked claims.
