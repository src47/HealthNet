This tab makes predictions on articles that a user can input as well as on text from a user-supplied URL. The predictions correspond to whether the article contains claims that are:
- “False”
- “Unproven”
- “True”
- “Mixture”

These labels are provided by independent fact-checkers. To evaluate new text there are two possible models to pick from: 

1. Baseline LSTM
2. Fine-tuned BERT
