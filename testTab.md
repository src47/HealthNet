This tab shows how the Baseline LSTM model performs on different slices of testing data. Here, the testing data can be sliced by word count, percentage of "?" and "!" characters in the article, average sentence length, and date published. For each of these spliting types you will be able to choose the value where the split occurs and evaluate the model performance on the slice with values greater than what was chosen and the model performance on the slice with values less than what was chosen. In addition, the per-class accuracy and the number of samples for each class is returned in order for the user to properly evaluate the effect of different slices on model performance.
